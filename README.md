## Introduction

This repository contains my adaptation of an assignment from the "Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies" book by Arvind Narayanan, Joseph Bonneau, Edward Felten, Andrew Miller, and Steven Goldfeder. The goal is to enhance understanding and practical application of a specific aspect of Bitcoin technology.

## Assignment Overview
### Assignment: Bitcoin BlockChain
- **Objective:** This is a programming assignment to help make you familiar with some aspects of the Bitcoin blockchain.
Note that many things here are different from the Bitcoin protocol. This is just a simplified version
- **Key Concepts:** transactions, blockchain, UTXO

## Installation
To run the assignment locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/princeton-bitcoin-assignment.git
   cd princeton-bitcoin-assignment
2. Ensure you have Java installed. You can download it from the [official Java website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).

3. Compile the Java files:
   ```bash
   javac -d bin src/*.java
